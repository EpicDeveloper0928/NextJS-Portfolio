## Overview

Development of a tool for viewing and analyzing forensic evidence from a web browser.

## Key Features

- **Component Library**: Built using Angular latest version with Material Design components.
- **Theming and Customization**: Integrated a theming system that allows easy switching and customization of color palettes, typography, and layout styles using CSS variables and Figma tokens.
- **Figma Integration**: Collaborated closely with designers by setting up a shared design library in Figma. This library was synchronized with the codebase, ensuring design handoffs were seamless and that design tokens remained consistent across both platforms.
- **API Integration**: Integrated with the GraphQL API to fetch and display forensic evidence data.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: For fast, user-friendly web applications.
- **Material Design**: For building a consistent, accessible user interface.
- **GraphQL**: For querying and managing large amounts of data efficiently.
- **Apollo Client**: For managing GraphQL queries and mutations.
- **RxJS**: For reactive programming and event handling.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was to build screenshot player with the ability to play, pause, stop, go to next and previous screenshot with event. The solution involved creating a custom Angular component that listens to events and updates the UI accordingly. Additionally, the screenshot player was built with the ability to handle large amounts of data efficiently. It was learning experience to build a component that can handle large amounts of data efficiently.

## Outcome

The tool was able to display forensic evidence data in a user-friendly way. And it has become a foundation for scaling our products efficiently while ensuring a cohesive user experience.
